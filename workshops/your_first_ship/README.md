The goal of this workshop is as an add on to any other workshop. It'll run members through joining the Slack and making a ship! It's a great way to mix up a club meeting and bring club members into the Slack community. It's a slideshow you can load up through the web: [your-first-ship.hackclub.com](https://your-first-ship.hackclub.com). 

It covers the following five steps:

1. Joining the Slack
2. Meeting Clippy & going through the onboarding
3. Finding the Ship Channel
4. Introducing Your Project
5. Shipping!

It's fairly simple and you can run through it in around 10 minutes.

## Preparing for the workshop

To prepare for the workshop the best thing to do is to familiarise yourself with the Slack joining process. Try going to [hackclub.com/slack](https://hackclub.com/slack) and making a dummy account to get a feel for it or run `/restart` to go through the Slack onboarding with Clippy.
