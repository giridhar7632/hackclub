## Overview
Lorenzo has been an enthusiastic collaborator with the Clubs Team since we started the 21-22 school year, so we knew he would be a good source of  detailed feedback about his experience running Muse as a workshop. He began by saying:

> I had a fantastic time working with Muse at my last meeting! I LOVED how open the “expectations” were; it wasn't like a normal workshop where
> there's a model that we are working but instead members were free to be creative from the start and take inspiration from others! I think this format is  > a really awesome change and better exemplifies the “hacker ethos”.

We were pretty happy that he enjoyed a different workshop model, and picked up on the whole creativity vibe we were going for. However it sounds like our lack of specificity around what to actually ‘do’ in Muse resulted in less than profound music-making, based on the rest of Lorenzo’s report. 

## Meeting Flow
Lorenzo noted that he didn’t feel that our intro video was the best way to begin - he liked how succinct it was, but “it was difficult to infuse the meeting with energy and excitement” with it, and found that people only referenced the documentation rather than the video while working in Muse. The video was also pretty quiet and the audio low quality. 

He also noticed that the “less musical members” of his club didn’t have any issues with the coding syntax, but weren’t as familiar with the necessary musical concepts like pitches, harmony, and accidentals. Lorenzo wrote “often we would start messing around, decide that we didn’t like what we made, and then tried something new.” This is actually the exact creative process that we were hoping for in Muse and it’s possible that Lorenzo and his friends simply aren’t familiar with the nagging self-doubt and false starts that typically accompany the task of composing music (speaking from experience). 

His club members would also try looking up the notation for songs they already knew, but lacked the ability to successfully translate them into code. Lorenzo suggests putting in a workshop component that would guide someone new to music notation through importing it into Muse. 

As of this writing Lorenzo didn’t share any example projects from the meeting, but this will be updated if any exist. 


## Conclusions 

This feedback reinforces a hunch that I had of Muse being somewhat inaccessible to non-musicians, not prohibitively so but enough that it may reduce the enjoyment of the experience.  I agree with Lorenzo that we may want to eventually update the workshop with a little bit more artistic direction. We initially wanted to avoid over-prescribing the creativity portion of the workshop, but I think having a trained musician (me) as the Muse beta-tester made us blind to how it presents to people with less background. Perhaps a more ‘lit’ intro video might inspire users. I would like to keep the development process of these workshops alive as we move forward with other ones, and Muse still feels somewhat unfinished. In general though I was happy at how much Lorenzo seemed to ‘get’ what we were going for around the themes of hackability and originality. And that he sent us such good feedback!
