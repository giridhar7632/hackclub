Have you ever heard about the popular BBC micro:bit? In this workshop we are going to work with BBC micro:bit and create a basis **Flappy Bird Game** using it. Check out the final project.

[![Final Project](https://cloud-ak4m6yygi.vercel.app/0final_output.gif)

Here's the [demo/code](https://makecode.microbit.org/_i6g2xLFeTTfP).

## How to play...

The objective is to direct a flying bird :bird: which is moving continuously to the right, between sets of obstacles. If the player touches an obstacle, they lose. You can check the original Flappy Bird Game [here](https://flappybird.io/).

## Prerequisites

We are going to use JavaScript to code our micro:bit. So you should have good knowledge of JavaScript and some ES6 concepts.

If you don't have the hardware, don't worry we'll use a simulator in this workshop. [Makecode's](https://makecode.microbit.org) micro:bit simulator is excellent!

## Getting Started

A micro:bit is a tiny piece of hardware with many features. It a pocket-sized computer which performs according to your instructions written in form of `program`. A micro USB cable is used to transfer the `program` from computer to micro:bit.

![micro:bit](https://cloud-kifx081bh.vercel.app/1microbit.jpg)

You can use different programming languages to program your micro:bit. You can use [Makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) to program in code blocks or JavaScript. You can also use [Python](https://python.microbit.org/v/2) to program a micro:bit.

On the front face, it has 25 LEDs which we will use to display our game. And on the back face, it have some awesome pre-built sensors.

These are the main parts of a micro:bit ðŸ‘‡

![micro:bit parts](https://cloud-kifx081bh.vercel.app/2microbitparts.jpg)

Learn more about micro:bit [here](https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/overview/).

## Setup

Open [Makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) and click on âž•`New Project`.

![Setup](https://cloud-kifx081bh.vercel.app/3setup.png)

Give it a name.

![naming project](https://cloud-kifx081bh.vercel.app/4name_your_roject.png)

You should see something like this. 

![Project created](https://cloud-kifx081bh.vercel.app/5preview.png)

Once you finish setting up, let's get going ðŸš€

## JavaScript

By default, MakeCode open's a project with code blocks. At top of the window, switch to JavaScript.

![JavaScript](https://cloud-kifx081bh.vercel.app/6javascript.png)

The MakeCode programming environment uses JavaScript along with the Static [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language. Don't worry about TypeScript. It is super similar to JavaScript. We will use many of the micro:bitâ€™s built-in JavaScript functions. For example, the `showString()` function displays a string on the LED screen. It will scroll to the left if itâ€™s bigger than the screen.

Try displaying your name. Here's mine: ðŸ˜Š

```js
basic.showString("Giridhar!")
```

![name](https://cloud-kifx081bh.vercel.app/7name.gif)

## Step 1: Add the Bird to the Game

Let's start with adding the bird. We just have 25 LEDs. So unfortunately, we'll have to assume a blinking LED as a bird ðŸ˜‚.

Don't mind about the previously existing code.

Create a new LED sprite pointing to the right.

```js
let bird: game.LedSprite = null
bird = game.createSprite(0, 2)
bird.set(LedSpriteProperty.Blink, 300)
```

Here, the variable `bird` is declared in TypeScript and initiated as `null`. One of the syntax of declaring a varible in TypeScript is: `let identifier:data-type = value;`. Learn more about variables in TypeScript [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/variable-declarations.html).

The `game.createSprite(x,y)` creates a sprite(our bird) in position (x, y) on the 5x5 grid of LEDs. 

![microbit-coordinates](https://cloud-aqjebemlu.vercel.app/0coordinates.png)

> âš  **Note:** A sprite is like a little LED creature you can tell what to do.

We can set the properties of the item using `set()` method. Then we set the `Blink` property of sprite for every 300 milliseconds.

You can see our bird flying like this: ðŸ‘‡

![blinking LED](https://cloud-70aevdanf.vercel.app/0bird.gif)

## Step 2: Make the Bird fly

Now let's add some controls so that we can move around.  Weâ€™ll control the bird by pressing the `A` button to go up or the `B` button to go down.

Micro:bit has built-in [event handlers](https://makecode.microbit.org/reference/event-handler) that are associated with a particular event, such as "button A pressed".  The `onButtonPressed()` handler works when button `A` or `B` is pressed, or `A` and `B` together. They are just like event listeners in JavaScript but with custom events.

```js
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, function () {
    bird.change(LedSpriteProperty.Y, -1)
})
input.onButtonPressed(Button.B, function () {
    bird.change(LedSpriteProperty.Y, 1)
})
```

Here, we use `change()` method to change property of the item. We can change the `Y` coordinate of the LED sprite using `change()` method.

Now when any of the 2 buttons is pressed, the position of the bird should change by 1 unit(up or down).

![controls](https://cloud-70aevdanf.vercel.app/1controls.gif)

## Step 3: Generating obstacles

Let's create some randomly generated obstacles for the bird to crash ðŸ’¥

Weâ€™ll keep all obstacles inside an array of Led Sprites. All obstacles will have a single hole for the bird to fly through.

First, create an array of `obstacles` that will hold all of the obstacle sprites.

```js
let obstacles: game.LedSprite[] = []
```

Now let's generate vertical obstacles consisting of 4 sprites and 1 random hole. Create a variable `emptyObstacleY` and store a random number between 0 and 4 in it. The function `randint(a,b)` creates a random number between `a` and `b`.

```js
let emptyObstacleY = 0
let obstacles: game.LedSprite[] = []

emptyObstacleY = randint(0, 4)
```

Using the `for` loop, iterate from 0 to 4. For every coordinate not equal to `emptyObstacleY`, create and add obstacle sprites to the end of the obstacles array using the `push()` method.

```js
let emptyObstacleY = 0
let obstacles: game.LedSprite[] = []

emptyObstacleY = randint(0, 4)
for (let index = 0; index <= 4; index++) {
    if (index != emptyObstacleY) {
        obstacles.push(game.createSprite(4, index))
    }
}
```

Now with every micro:bit restart you should see different automatically generated vertical obstacles.

![random obstacles](https://cloud-70aevdanf.vercel.app/2random_obstacles.gif)

Before continuing, make sure that obstacles are generated randomly and that the bird is moving up and down. If it doesn't work as expected, try to cross check your code.

## Step 4: Make obstacles move

Let's make the obstacles move towards the bird. We have to make them move forever. The code inside `basic.forever()` keeps running in the background forever. 

Inside `forever()` access each obstacle using a `for` loop (iterate over the obstacles array) and decrease the obstacle `X` coordinate by `1` so that we can see them moving towards left. 

```js
let obstacles: game.LedSprite[] = []

basic.forever(() => {
    for (let obstacle of obstacles) {
        obstacle.change(LedSpriteProperty.X, -1)
    }
    basic.pause(1000)
})
```

Here, `basic.pause()` pauses the program for 1000 milliseconds(i.e., 1 second) for our convenience. You can control the speed of the obstacles by changing the pause time. 

Now obstacles should move towards the left every second.

![moving obstacles](https://cloud-70aevdanf.vercel.app/3moving_onstacles.gif)

## Step 5: Make obstacles disappear

Now let's make obstacles disappear after reaching the leftmost corner(i.e if their `X` coordinate is equal to `0`). Iterate over all obstacles, delete the obstacle sprites where the `X` coordinate equals `0`, and remove them from the `obstacles` array. We can use `get()` method to read the properties of an item. The `removeAt(n)` method is used to remove an element at `n` in an array and `delete()` method is used to delete it.

```js
let obstacles: game.LedSprite[] = []

basic.forever(() => {
    while (obstacles.length > 0 && obstacles[0].get(LedSpriteProperty.X) == 0) {
        obstacles.removeAt(0).delete()
    }

    for (let obstacle of obstacles) {
        obstacle.change(LedSpriteProperty.X, -1)
    }
    basic.pause(1000)
})
```

Now you see that when the obstacle reaches the bird it will just disappear.

![disappearing obstacle](https://cloud-70aevdanf.vercel.app/4disappearing_obstacles.gif)

## Step 6: Generate more obstacles

At the moment, our code generates just one vertical obstacle at a time. We need to put [obstacle generation code](#step-3:-generating-obstacles) into the `forever` loop so that it keeps generating more and more obstacles.

```js
let emptyObstacleY = 0
let obstacles: game.LedSprite[] = []

basic.forever(() => {
    // all the previous code
    
    emptyObstacleY = randint(0, 4)
    for (let index = 0; index <= 4; index++) {
        if (index != emptyObstacleY) {
            obstacles.push(game.createSprite(4, index))
        }
    }
    basic.pause(1000)
})
```

Now our screen is full of moving obstacles like this: ðŸ‘‡

![multiple obstacles](https://cloud-70aevdanf.vercel.app/5multiple_obs.gif)

Let's create some spaces between generated obstacles. Create a new variable `ticks` to count how many iterations the forever loop has done and execute obstacle creation only `if` ticks is divisible by `3`. The space between the obstacles depends on the number you use. Try add different numbers insted of `3` and observe the patterns generated. ðŸ˜‡

```js
let ticks = 0        
let emptyObstacleY = 0
let obstacles: game.LedSprite[] = []

basic.forever(() => {
    // all the previous code
    
    if (ticks % 3 == 0) {           
        emptyObstacleY = randint(0, 4)
        for (let index = 0; index <= 4; index++) {
            if (index != emptyObstacleY) {
                obstacles.push(game.createSprite(4, index))
            }
        }
    }
    ticks += 1
    basic.pause(1000)
})
```

Now you can see obstacles created with a space of `2` blocks between them and moving towards the left.

![Moving left](https://cloud-70aevdanf.vercel.app/6crashing_obstacles.gif)

## Step 7: Game Over

We are now in the last part of creating the Flappy Bird game. 

Right now nothing happens when the bird is hits an obstacle. We should end the game when the bird crashes into an obstacle. The built-in function `gameover()` ends the game and shows some cool animations. 

To do this, we have to iterate over the `obstacles` array and check if any `obstacle` sprite's coordinates are the same as the `bird`'s coordinates. If this condition turns out to be true, we call the `gameover()` function.

```js
let bird: game.LedSprite = null
let ticks = 0
let emptyObstacleY = 0
let obstacles: game.LedSprite[] = []

basic.forever(() => {
    // all the previous code

    for (let obstacle of obstacles) {
        if (obstacle.get(LedSpriteProperty.X) == bird.get(LedSpriteProperty.X) && obstacle.get(LedSpriteProperty.Y) == bird.get(LedSpriteProperty.Y)) {
            game.gameOver()
        }
    }

    ticks += 1
    basic.pause(1000)
})
```

Now the game ends when the bird is hit by an obstacle.

![Game over](https://cloud-70aevdanf.vercel.app/7game_over.gif)

Our final code should look something like this:

```js
let ticks = 0
let emptyObstacleY = 0
let obstacles: game.LedSprite[] = []
let index = 0
let bird: game.LedSprite = null
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, () => {
    bird.change(LedSpriteProperty.Y, -1)
})
input.onButtonPressed(Button.B, () => {
    bird.change(LedSpriteProperty.Y, 1)
})
index = 0
obstacles = []
bird = game.createSprite(0, 2)
bird.set(LedSpriteProperty.Blink, 300)
basic.forever(() => {
    while (obstacles.length > 0 && obstacles[0].get(LedSpriteProperty.X) == 0) {
        obstacles.removeAt(0).delete()
    }
    for (let obstacle2 of obstacles) {
        obstacle2.change(LedSpriteProperty.X, -1)
    }
    if (ticks % 3 == 0) {
        emptyObstacleY = randint(0, 4)
        for (let index2 = 0; index2 <= 4; index2++) {
            if (index2 != emptyObstacleY) {
                obstacles.push(game.createSprite(4, index2))
            }
        }
    }
    for (let obstacle3 of obstacles) {
        if (obstacle3.get(LedSpriteProperty.X) == bird.get(LedSpriteProperty.X) && obstacle3.get(LedSpriteProperty.Y) == bird.get(LedSpriteProperty.Y)) {
            game.gameOver()
        }
    }
    ticks += 1
    basic.pause(1000)
})
```

## Step 8: Working with Hardware

If you are using hardware, connect the micro:bit to PC using USB cable. Now Click on the `Download` button and follow the instructions.

You're all set. Now you can just play the game. ðŸ˜‹

![game](https://cloud-ak4m6yygi.vercel.app/0final_output.gif)

That's it! You created a simple Flappy Bird game on a micro:bit. âœŒ

![well done](https://cloud-70aevdanf.vercel.app/8well_done.gif)

## Hacking 

It's time for you to take charge.

- Try to count and show the game score. We have a built-in function `score()` for counting score. Learn more [here](https://makecode.microbit.org/reference/game/score).

- Try to make the obstacles move faster every time an obstacle is passed.

- We can play music using the micro:bit. You can explore it [here](https://makecode.microbit.org/reference/music/play-tone). Try to add sound when the bird is hit by an obstacle.

- As said, micro:bit is wonderful. It has so many built-in sensors. An accelerometer can check how the micro:bit is moving. Try to control the bird by tilting the micro:bit. You can use the `input.rotate()` function to find how much the micro:bit is tilted in different directions. You can learn more [here](https://makecode.microbit.org/reference/input/rotation).

## Inspiration

These are some examples from the makers of the micro:bit to inspire you.


- Adding score: [Simple clicking game](https://makecode.microbit.org/_gmtb8R03YU6e)- Press button `A` as much as possible to increase the score. Press `B` to display the score and reset the score.
