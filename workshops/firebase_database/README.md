# Firebase Database

Have you ever created a database for web applications? In this workshop, we are going to create a realtime database using google's Firebase. We are going to build something like this.

![Final Project](https://cloud-3a2lu9qq3.vercel.app/2screenshot_2020-11-09_163829.png)

[Live Demo](https://firebase-database.giridharhackclu.repl.co/).  [Source Code](https://repl.it/@Giridharhackclu/firebase-database#src/App.js).

Every time you submit the form, the input is given will be updated to the database.

## Prerequisites

![Prerequisites](https://cloud-l2ccvbjwj.vercel.app/0screenshot_2020-11-09_213901.png)

You should have some intermediate knowledge about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Also some fundamentals of React and React-Hooks. 

## Getting started

### Database

![Database](https://cloud-l2ccvbjwj.vercel.app/1screenshot_2020-11-09_220807.png)

A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are more complex they are often developed using formal design and modelling techniques. Learn more about database [here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zf2f9j6/articles/z8yk87h).

### Database as a service 

![Database as a service](https://cloud-l2ccvbjwj.vercel.app/2screenshot_2020-11-09_221151.png)

Database as a service (DBaaS) is a cloud computing managed service offering that provides access to a database without requiring the setup of physical hardware, the installation of software or the need to configure the database. It is a product which you can use easily, without creating and configuring. One of such type of products is `Firebase`, which is created by Google. `Firebase` is great, free(up to some extinct) and easy to use the product. It has many services like authentication, cloud storage, realtime database, etc.. In this workshop, we are going to use the realtime database of Firebase.

### Firebase

<img src="https://cloud-1swt5hmba.vercel.app/5firebase_realtime_database__1-_icon__dark_.png" alt="Firebase REaltime Database" width="200px" height="auto"/>

The Firebase Realtime Database is cloud-hosted. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. We can store and sync data across all clients in realtime and remains available when your app goes offline. 

> **Realtime means**: Instead of typical HTTP requests, the Firebase Realtime Database uses data synchronizationâ€”every time data changes, any connected device receives that update within milliseconds. Provide collaborative and immersive experiences without thinking about the networking code.

Learn more about Firebase [here](https://youtu.be/U5aeM5dvUpA)

In this workshop, we will create a form, which stores data into Firebase realtime database, when submitted, using [React](https://reactjs.org). 

## Setting up..

### Code editor

We will be using [Repl.it](https://repl.it) for building our project. Repl.it is an online code editor, where you can code in many different languages without any installations.

Fork this starter repl [here](https://repl.it/@Giridharhackclu/firebase-database-starter). It contains a [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [firebase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase) installed. The starter-template contains all the styles required so that we can concentrate on React and Firebase. Click the `Run` button to check your template. You should see something like this.

![Repl](https://cloud-3a2lu9qq3.vercel.app/1screenshot_2020-11-09_160050.png)

### Creating a Firebase project

You can access [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) with your [Google account](https://myaccount.google.com/). After signing in, click the `Go to console`  on the top right corner.

![Firebase](https://cloud-m3srogzel.vercel.app/0screenshot_2020-11-10_101346.png)

Then in your console, If you don't have any projects yet, it will be clean and empty. Click on `Create project` to add a new project.

![Console](https://cloud-1swt5hmba.vercel.app/0screenshot_2020-11-09_222607.png)

Complete all the steps to create a firebase project. Name your project as you wish.

![Step-1](https://cloud-1swt5hmba.vercel.app/1screenshot_2020-11-09_222741.png)

After giving a name to your project click the continue button to proceed further. Here is an optional step where you can use Google Analytics for your project, but in this workshop, you won't need it. Click on `Continue`.

![Step-2](https://cloud-1swt5hmba.vercel.app/4screenshot_2020-11-09_224518.png)

Click on `Create Project` to finish setting up your project. After the project was created you will see something like this.

![Project setup](https://cloud-axyxh81oj.vercel.app/0screenshot_2020-11-10_122542.png)

Then hop on to repl.it and start coding.

## Part-1

### Create a form

Now we are going to create a form to get the input from the user. 

We can say that forms in HTML are slightly different from that are in React. The form elements like `<input />`, `<select />`, `<textarea />` are responsible on their own to handle the user input and update their respective values. But in React, the forms are controlled by components using `state`.
Learn more about React forms [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html).

Now navigate to `App.js` file, and create a `<form>`  with two `<input>` elements for `Name` and `Email` with respective labels, and a `Submit` button.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <form>
        <h1>Form</h1>
        <label type="Name: ">
        <input type="text" placeholder="Your Name" />
        </label>
        <label type="Email: ">
        <input type="email" placeholder="Your Email" />
        </label>
        <button> Submit </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Click the `Run` button and check your output. All the styles are prewritten. Don't wonder to see this output.

![form output](https://cloud-naxgpvrzh.vercel.app/0screenshot_2020-11-10_121610.png)

### Handling the form

Handling forms is about how you handle the data when value changes or gets submitted.

In HTML, form data is usually handled by the DOM. In React, form data is usually handled by the components.

When the data is handled by the components, all the data is stored in the component state. You can control changes by adding event handlers in the `onChange` attribute.

Let's create two state variables each for name and email. 

Don't forget to import `useState` hook from React to use `state`.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';     //<----------- useState hook is imported here
import './App.css'

function App(){
  const [name, setName] = useState("")
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("")
  
  return(
  //all the previous code
  )
}
```
  
Now add an event handler in the `onChange` attribute. Here, event handler updates the state every time you enter a letter(i.e, input changed). 

```jsx
// all the previous code
  return(
    <div className="container">
      <form>
        <h1>Form</h1>
        <label type="Name: ">
        <input 
          type="text" 
          value={name} 
          onChange={handleName}         //<--------------  event handler
          placeholder="Your Name" 
        />
        </label>
        <label type="Email: ">
        <input 
          type="email" 
          value={email} 
          onChange={handleEmail}          //<------------- event handler
          placeholder="Your Email" 
        />
        </label>
        <button> Submit </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  )
 ```

Let's create `handleName` and `handleEmail` functions for updating state with values of respective inputs.

```js
// for handling name
function handleName(e) {
  setName(e.target.value)
}
// for handling email
function handleEmail(e) {
  setEmail(e.target.value)
}
```

At this stage, our `App.js` looks like this.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'; 
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("")
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("")

  // for handling name
  function handleName(e) {
    setName(e.target.value)
  }
  // for handling email
  function handleEmail(e) {
    setEmail(e.target.value)
  }

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <form>
        <h1>Form</h1>
        <label type="Name: ">
        <input 
          type="text" 
          value={name} 
          onChange={handleName} 
          placeholder="Your Name" 
        />
        </label>
        <label type="Email: ">
        <input 
          type="email" 
          value={email} 
          onChange={handleEmail}
          placeholder="Your Email" 
        />
        </label>
        <button> Submit </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Submitting Forms

You can control the submit action by adding an event handler in the `onClick` attribute. Create a function `handleSubmit`. Let's first print the form data in `console`. And clear the inputs, every time submitted.

```javascript
// for submitting form
function handleSubmit(e){
    console.log(name, email)      //<----------- to print form data in console
    setName("")
    setEmail("")
    e.preventDefault()
  }
```

Usually, on submission of the form, the whole page will be refreshed as default. So we used the [preventDefault()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault) method to prevent the default behaviour of the form. 

Call it inside the `onClick` event attribute of button.

```jsx
<button onClick={handleSubmit} > Submit </button>
```

<details>
<summary>The final `App.js` so far looks like this.</summary>
  
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("")
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("")

  // for handling name
  function handleName(e) {
    setName(e.target.value)
  }
  
  // for handling email
  function handleEmail(e) {
    setEmail(e.target.value)
  }
  
  // for handling submit
  function handleSubmit(e){
    console.log(name, email)
    setName("")
    setEmail("")
    e.preventDefault()
  }

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <form>
        <h1>Form</h1>
        <label type="Name: ">
        <input 
          type="text" 
          value={name} 
          onChange={handleName} 
          placeholder="Your Name" 
        />
        </label>
        <label type="Email: ">
        <input 
          type="email" 
          value={email} 
          onChange={handleEmail}
          placeholder="Your Email" 
        />
        </label>
        <button onClick={handleSubmit} > Submit </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

</details>

Click the `Run` button and check the output. If you get the value of inputs in the console, then you are good to go.

![Submitting data](https://cloud-d4dcm2tr0.vercel.app/0ezgif.com-gif-maker__6_.gif)

Now that we have a form for adding data to the database, means the front-end part was completed. 

![Good job](https://cloud-ac5q22xg1.vercel.app/0good_job.gif)

## Part-2

### Creating Database

Now open the [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com) you left before and open the current project folder. We can use firebase for different platforms. But for now, we are going to use it for `web(</>)`. Click on `</>` button. You will see something like this.

![Console output](https://cloud-j3vz1auk3.vercel.app/0ezgif.com-gif-maker__7_.gif)

Then register your app with a name. I'm going to give this name.

![Add name](https://cloud-4zt4ppz2y.vercel.app/0screenshot_2020-11-10_145514.png)

Click on `continue`. Then you will get `Firebase SDK` data. Every user has their own `API` key and Id. Copy the code in the `<script>`. This contains the data to access your firebase.

![SDK Data](https://cloud-4zt4ppz2y.vercel.app/1screenshot_2020-11-10_145822.png)

### Configuring Project with Firebase

Hop on to your code editor(repl) and create a new file in `src` folder. Name it as `Firebase.js`. Then import the `firebase` module, which is already installed, and paste the data you copied from firebase. Your `Firebase.js` file will be like this with **your API keys**.

```javascript
import firebase from 'firebase'     //<--------------- importing firebase 

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyAcg8MxG_vX65Vfh2fAoH9tuyHUn85JqNQ",
  authDomain: "test-form-f2df9.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://test-form-f2df9.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "test-form-f2df9",
  storageBucket: "test-form-f2df9.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "684489897467",
  appId: "1:684367456467:web:7fff9d88d6accf5426ae0e",
  measurementId: "G-YV81RWDHS5"
}

var fireBase = firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig)     //<--------------- initialising firebase
export default fireBase
```

This is for configuring firebase with our React project. Now let's create a realtime database on firebase. Go back to your firebase console and click the `Realtime Database` on the sidebar.

![Sidebar](https://cloud-2zamqusnb.vercel.app/0screenshot__3__li.jpg)

Then click on `Create Database`.

![Create Database](https://cloud-4zhtbdxo9.vercel.app/0screenshot__4__li.jpg)

Make sure you create it in `Test Mode`. It will enable loose options without strict rules.

![Test Mode](https://cloud-bugaglghj.vercel.app/0screenshot_2020-11-10_153651.png)

Then your realtime database will be initiated with `null`(means, nothing in it).

![Database](https://cloud-bugaglghj.vercel.app/1screenshot_2020-11-10_153751.png)

The rules here are important. Initially, firebase allows anyone to read and write data in the database for up to 30 days. You can change the settings at any time in the `Rules` tab.

Make sure `write` is set to true. Otherwise, you cannot add data to Firebase.

Now we created the database and configured it with our project. Then let's add data to it.

## Part-3

Before adding data to our firebase, let's first understand how data is structured in firebase.

### How is data organised in Firebase?

Data in Firebase is organised in tree-like structure using [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp)(JavaScript Object Notation).

All Firebase Realtime Database data is stored as JSON objects. You can think of the database as a cloud-hosted JSON tree. Unlike a SQL database, there are no tables or records. When you add data to the JSON tree, it becomes a node in the existing JSON structure with an associated key. You can provide your own keys, such as user IDs or semantic names, or they can be provided for you using `push()`. Learn more about Firebase data [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/structure-data?authuser=0).

![json tree](https://cloud-ihe3nkqdq.vercel.app/0screenshot_2020-11-11_192057.png)

You can access nodes of data(collections) using references - `firebase.database.ref()` 

Now `import` your `Firebase.js` component into your app component.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import fireBase from './Firebase';       // <------------------ importing Firebase configuration

// All the previous code 
```

### Saving data to Firebase

In the `handleSubmit` create a collection with a reference called `form-data` in the database. 

```jsx
let dataRef = fireBase.database().ref('form-data')     // <--------------- creates a reference in database
```

Now we have to use the `push()` method to append data to the database. 

```jsx
dataRef.push()
```

The `push()` method generates a unique key every time a new child is added to the specified Firebase reference. The unique key generated by `push()` is based on a timestamp, so list items are automatically ordered chronologically. We can set the values to `child` using `set()` method. 

> **Note**: If you use `set()` method without using `push()` method, then the entire data in the database will be **replaced** by current data.

The final `handleSubmit` function will be:

```jsx
// All the previous code

function handleSubmit(e) {
  let dataRef = fireBase.database().ref('form-data')
  dataRef.push().set({
    name: name,
    email: email
  })
    
}
// All the previous code
```

Here, we are sending the `object` of data to our collection of `form-data` reference in firebase.

<details>
<summary> Our App.js so far: </summary>

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import './App.css'
import fireBase from './Firebase'


function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("")
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("")

  function handleName(e) {
    setName(e.target.value)
  }
  function handleEmail(e) {
    setEmail(e.target.value)
  }
  function handleSubmit(e) {
    let dataRef = fireBase.database().ref('form-data')
    dataRef.push().set({
      name: name,
      email: email
    })  
    console.log(name, email)
    setName("")
    setEmail("")
    setTimeout(() => {
      setSubmit(false)
    }, 3000)
    e.preventDefault()
  }
  
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <form>
      <h1> Form </h1>
        <label type="Name:">
          <input type="text" value={name} onChange={handleName} placeholder="Your Name"/>
        </label>
        <label type="Email:">
          <input type="email" value={email} onChange={handleEmail} placeholder="Your Email"/>
        </label>
        <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

</details>

Now `Run` the code and try to submit some information.

After submission you'll see a collection of `form-data`, inside it you can see the data you submitted.

![Data in database](https://cloud-bt7imez8z.vercel.app/0screenshot_2020-11-11_185920.png)

You can notice that the submitted data is updated to the database in realtime. You don't even have to refresh the window.

## Hacking

We created a database and added data to it through a form. It's time for you to take a role.

* In Firebase, you can create and delete data directly in database.
* Try to validate the form. You can use conditional rendering for achieving this.
* Try inputting different types of inputs.
* You can also data of high-score of your game, update every time and display it on the webpage.
* You can create different collection in your database. Try adding different reference for the name, email and message for the above example.
* Here, we created different handle events for different elements. But if you have a form with more number of inputs, you will be violating `Do Not Repeat Yourself` principle of programming. Try create a custom hook, for handling the form. Learn about creating custom hooks [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html).

Also explore different services of Firebase [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup?authuser=0).

Try using Firebase in your projects and share it with me on slack. I'm as [@Giridhar]() on slack. I'd love to hear from you. Hope you love this workshop. :v:
